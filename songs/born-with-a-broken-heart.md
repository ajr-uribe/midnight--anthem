[00:04.32] I've been tryin' to change (oh-oh, oh-oh)
[00:09.45] Tryna find somebody to love me
[00:13.36] Oh no, but I end up in the same damn place again
[00:21.07] Hoping that I could be different, but I'd be playin' pretend
[00:26.49] I wish that I was perfect (just like you)
[00:32.08] But I'm an alien
[00:35.62] Oh no, I'm setting out an SOS, take me home
[00:43.32] We're not meant to be together, no
[00:51.88] What if I said I'm tryin' to save your love from dyin'?
[00:57.48] Baby, I'm too far gone (oh, oh, oh)
[01:03.10] Don't wanna see you cryin', but I just know who I am
[01:08.51] And maybe that's the hardest part of-
[01:14.36] Baby, you can't fix me
[01:16.83] I was born with a broken heart
[01:20.06] If I was a cactus (oh-oh, oh-oh)
[01:25.52] You would be a balloon
[01:29.05] Oh no, I wanna feel the same as humans do
[01:36.55] I wanna feel the same as you, but I don't
[01:45.18] What if I said I'm tryin' to save your love from dyin'?
[01:50.67] Baby, I'm too far gone (oh, oh, oh)
[01:56.26] Don't wanna see you cryin', but I just know who I am
[02:01.77] And maybe that's the hardest part of-
[02:07.46] Baby, you can't fix me
[02:09.93] I was born with a broken heart
[02:14.51] I'm sorry that I'm leavin'
[02:22.26] Oh-oh, I'm, I'm sorry, we're just different
[02:35.24] But, baby, you can't fix me
[02:40.98] What if I said I'm tryin' to save your love from dyin'?
[02:46.45] Baby, I'm too far gone (oh, oh, oh)
[02:52.19] Don't wanna see you cryin', but I just know who I am
[02:57.42] And maybe that's the hardest part of-
[03:03.38] Baby, you can't fix me (oh, oh, oh)
[03:08.93] Baby, you can't fix me, no
[03:14.48] Baby, you can't fix me
[03:16.95] I was born with a broken heart
